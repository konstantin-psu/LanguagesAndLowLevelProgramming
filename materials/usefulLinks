    This link will take you to a page where you can download Intel's extensive documentation for
    the Intel and IA32 architectures.  Among the thousands of pages of information provided here,
    the parts that are likely to be of most use for this course are:
        Volumes 2A and 2B, which provide reference pages for specific instructions (with initial
        letter A-M in Volume 2A and N-Z in Volume 2B); useful if you need to check specific details
        of a particular instruction.  Note that the pdf files include a table of contents section
        that you can access directly in standard pdf viewers to navigate around the documents.
        Volume 3A, which covers essential parts of the "operating-system support environment" of the
        IA32 architecture.
